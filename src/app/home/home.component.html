        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
            knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
            storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
            educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal
            settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
            considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy..</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
            knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
            orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
            the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
            through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
            Kingdom.

            Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of
            Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle
            of Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European
            civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476..

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary
            education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a
            high school or secondary school. Tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and
            postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. Colleges and universities mainly
            provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions.
            Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic
            degrees..</p>
